# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

### Reactotron integration

#### Android usefull instructions and commands

- connect device with usbc cable
- `adb devices`
- `adb reverse tcp:9090 tcp:9090`
- `adb logcat -s ReactNativeJS` to see console.log of reanimated `worklet`

  - Delete cocoa pods cache: `rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/CocoaPods`
  - Delete the Pods folder and the `Podfile.lock` usually located in `<project_root>/ios`.
  - Reinstall pods: `pod update`
